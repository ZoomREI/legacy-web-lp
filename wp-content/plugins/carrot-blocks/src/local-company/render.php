        Have you heard about all these national home buying companies that buy
        houses? Yes, the ones you see all over because they spend so much
        money on advertising! They must buy the houses very cheap to cover for
        these ads cost!
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we are a <strong>local, family-owned company</strong> here in
        <?php echo $selected_market; ?>, and we can pay more than many other investment companies
        that donâ€™t know the market as well as we do!
    </p>
    <p>
        We buy homes in <?php echo $selected_market; ?> and we make sure that we provide the best
        solution for you, the homeowner!
