        When selling a property to “<?php echo $selected_market; ?>”,
        <strong>you don’t need to deal with inspectors</strong>, asking you to repair things just because they are older. You also
        don’t need to clean once you moved out, just
        <strong>leave unwanted things behind</strong> – We’ll either donate it
        or get rid of it for you!
